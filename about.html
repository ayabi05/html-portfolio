<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an entry level programmer. Currently I build websites on Webflow. In the future I wanna become a full-stack programmer who builds websites and mobile apps for companies such as Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc.</p>

<p>My journey in IT started sudeenly by me quitting my full-time job. I once wanted to be a programmer, now I am on it.</p>

<p>What I like about coding is that it has its language and via its help we can build stuff. BTW, the language is not complicated like some other people's languages.</p>
